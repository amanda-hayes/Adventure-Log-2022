# The Adventure Log

A virtual D&D experience that allows players to create characters, go on quests and fight monsters right from their own computers. Are you new to D&D and looking to learn more about the game before diving in to a full campaign? Are you looking to get your feet wet to find out if you even like it? Are you stuck at home or between campaigns and just want a little more dungeons in your life with possibly some dragons as well? Start your quest today with The Adventure Log!

# How to Play

Players begin by visiting the homepage and clicking "Start your Adventure." This directs them to their player dashboard, where they have the option of creating a new character for their party, generating a random character, editing or deleting their current characters, or starting a new quest. After they have created their party, they can select from the available quests and get started! The game prompts will guide them through the rest.

# Tech Stack

This app was created using Express, Nodejs, React, MongoDB, Bootstrap and Cypress. The API on the Express server has the RESTful routes that make the full CRUD functionality possible. I used bcrypt and json webtoken for user authentication and authorization and connected to Mongoose to manage MongoDB. On the client side, I included React Router Dom and React Boostrap for routing and styling, respectively.

If you have questions or issues about the game, feel free to reach out and send me a message!

# Updates

July, 19, 2022: In order to make a more object-oriented and robust app, I separated some of the character details into separate models.
